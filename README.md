# matchminer-ai

## Overview

`matchminer-ai` is a Python package for running the clinical trial matching inference workflow described in [Altreuter et al., MatchMiner-AI: An Open-Source Solution for Cancer Clinical Trial Matching](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.17228). The package provides modular functions for the core MatchMiner-AI workflow: summarizing trials and patient histories, generating embeddings of each, retrieving candidate matches, scoring match quality, and assessing exclusion criteria.

Optional source-grounded extensions can also:

- research matched trials using ClinicalTrials.gov drug/biological intervention
  names and compare them after that patient-free web step; and
- contextualize a trial space using heading-aware NCI PDQ, FDA
  companion-diagnostic and DailyMed material, accepted CIViC evidence, focused
  PubMed searches, and permissively licensed Europe PMC guideline/consensus
  full text.

Trial-space retrieval rejects patient-bearing columns. Patient personalization
is a separate API that sends patient context only to the configured LLM
backend. These extensions produce research considerations, not treatment
recommendations, guideline compliance, or eligibility determinations.

For detailed instructions, please see the
[documentation website](https://dfci.github.io/matchminer-ai-inference/).

> [!WARNING]
> This package is currently pre-v1 and under active development.

## Compute requirements

A GPU is recommended for the clinical trial matching inference workflow. Please see the
[requirements documentation](https://dfci.github.io/matchminer-ai-inference/getting-started/requirements/)
for more information on compute expectations and GPU recommendations.

## Installation

This package requires Python 3.12+.

The package has been tested in Linux environments.

We recommend using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to create the Python
environment and install the package:

```shell
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install matchminer-ai
```
