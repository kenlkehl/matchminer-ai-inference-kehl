## Structured trial-space schema

`structure_trial_space` accepts one free-text clinical-space summary and returns
a JSON-compatible dictionary containing its `trial_id` and `space_trial_id`.
The package trial summarizer defines each space as a single cancer-type and
histology combination, so this API structures one space at a time. Its output
contains:

- `age_range` and `sex_allowed`;
- OncoTree-grounded `cancer_type` and `histology` objects;
- `cancer_burden_allowed`, constrained to
  `early_or_curative_intent` and/or `advanced_or_palliative_intent`;
- `prior_treatment_required` and `prior_treatment_excluded`, preserving each
  source requirement, response requirement, and NCIt-normalized drug; and
- `biomarkers_required` and `biomarkers_excluded`, with one object per marker
  and an explicit screening-assessment flag.

The OncoTree agent sees only one hierarchy level at a time. The NCIt agent sees
only bounded search candidates and retrieves full definitions only for
candidate indices it selects. A complete ontology is never placed in LLM
context.
