# Configuration Reference

Most package behavior is controlled through configuration. Configuration tells
`matchminer-ai` which models to use, whether LLM calls should run locally or
through a remote endpoint, where to cache model metadata, and how individual
workflow steps should be run.

Most users can start with the built-in default settings. You usually only need
to change configuration when you want to change models, switch between local and
remote inference, adjust runtime settings, enable debug output, or point the
package at a different endpoint.

Use `load_default_preset()` when you want to start from the package defaults and
change a few values in Python:

```python
from matchminer_ai import load_default_preset

config = load_default_preset()
config.remote["enabled"] = True
config.remote["server_urls"] = ["http://localhost:8000/v1"]
```

## Custom Config Files

For package installs, treat the built-in preset files as read-only package data.
For larger or reusable changes, copy the default preset values into a YAML file
in your project, edit them, and load that file by path:

```python
from matchminer_ai import load_config

config = load_config("my_config.yaml")
```

## Root Keys

### `debug_mode`

Boolean flag used by summarization postprocessing. When true, selected
intermediate columns are retained in output tables.

### `model_metadata_cache_dir`

Directory path used by model metadata helpers to cache Hugging Face model
metadata JSON files.

## `remote`

Global transport settings used when `remote.enabled` is true and LLM tasks send
OpenAI-compatible chat completion requests to external endpoints. The default
tested setup is a vLLM server with a compatible reasoning parser.
Task-specific request payload settings live under each task's `remote` block.
The remote backend reads the API key from the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment
variable. API keys are not stored in preset files.

### `remote.enabled`

Selects the remote LLM backend when true.

### `remote.server_urls`

List of OpenAI-compatible base URLs. Values are passed to the OpenAI client as
`base_url`. For the default Gemma 4 configuration, the server should be a vLLM
chat endpoint launched with the `gemma4` reasoning parser; the package
`start_vllm_servers()` helper adds this flag from the selected LLM task's
`reasoning_parser`.

Model names and request parameters are configured per LLM task under that
task's backend block. For example, `trial.local.model_name` is the model loaded
by local vLLM, `trial.remote.model_name` is the model string sent to the
endpoint, `trial.remote.request_params` contains top-level chat completion
request fields, and `trial.remote.extra_body` contains fields sent through
request `extra_body`.

Remote mode expects the endpoint to return final answer text in
`message.content`. The default vLLM/Gemma setup can expose reasoning separately
via vLLM reasoning parser support. Other OpenAI-compatible endpoints may work
only if they return final answer text in `message.content`; endpoints that
include reasoning text in `message.content` are not currently supported.

### `remote.max_concurrent_requests`

Maximum number of concurrent requests per remote server.

### `remote.request_timeout`

Request timeout in seconds.

### `remote.max_retries`

Maximum retry attempts for a failed remote request.

### `remote.batch_size`

Number of prompts processed per remote-server batch.

### `remote.retry_backoff_base`

Base value, in seconds, for exponential retry backoff.

## `trial`

Task configuration for trial summarization.

### `trial.local`

Local in-process vLLM runtime settings:

- `model_name`: model identifier loaded by local vLLM and used for local
  tokenizer/chat-template rendering and model metadata lookup.
- `engine`: keyword arguments passed to `vllm.LLM(...)`; the package passes
  `model=trial.local.model_name` separately.
- `generation`: keyword arguments passed to `vllm.SamplingParams(...)`.
- `chat_template_kwargs`: keyword arguments passed to tokenizer chat-template
  rendering.

Additional `engine` and `generation` keys may be included if they are valid vLLM
keyword arguments. vLLM validates those keys when the engine/request is created.

### `trial.prompt_files`

Prompt template filenames loaded from `matchminer_ai.prompts`.

### `trial.reasoning_parser`

vLLM reasoning parser name. The default `auto` resolves known model names,
including `google/gemma-4-31B-it` to `gemma4`. Set this explicitly when using a
model not covered by the package mapping, or use `none` to disable reasoning
parsing for a non-reasoning model. This setting applies to local vLLM execution
and vLLM server launch helpers; non-vLLM remote endpoints may ignore it or
return no separate reasoning field.

### `trial.remote`

Task-specific remote chat completion request settings:

- `model_name`: model name sent in OpenAI-compatible chat completion requests
  and used for remote endpoint metadata.
- `request_params`: top-level chat completion request fields sent as-is,
  including the output-token budget. Use `max_tokens` for vLLM and many
  compatible endpoints, or `max_completion_tokens` for endpoints that require
  it.
- `extra_body`: provider-specific fields sent as request `extra_body` when
  non-empty.

The package interprets `model_name`. Values inside `request_params` and
`extra_body` are pass-through: the package does not validate those keys, and
the OpenAI client or remote endpoint is responsible for accepting or rejecting
them.

### `trial.boilerplate_marker`

Line marker used by trial postprocessing to identify the boilerplate exclusion
section heading.

## `patient`

Task configuration for patient summarization.

### `patient.chunk_size`

Maximum character count used when splitting patient notes into serial summary
chunks.

### `patient.chunk_overlap`

Character overlap between adjacent patient-note chunks.

### `patient.prompt_margin_tokens`

Token margin reserved when truncating patient chunks before prompt rendering.

### `patient.local`

Local in-process vLLM runtime settings. See `trial.local`.

### `patient.prompt_files`

Prompt template filenames loaded from `matchminer_ai.prompts`.

### `patient.reasoning_parser`

vLLM reasoning parser name. The default `auto` resolves known model names,
including `google/gemma-4-31B-it` to `gemma4`. Set this explicitly when using a
model not covered by the package mapping, or use `none` to disable reasoning
parsing for a non-reasoning model. Non-vLLM remote endpoints may return no
separate reasoning field.

### `patient.remote`

Task-specific remote chat completion request settings. See `trial.remote`.
Patient summarization also supports `tokenizer_name`, which is the local
tokenizer used for patient chunk truncation and prompt sizing before sending
requests to the remote endpoint. For self-hosted vLLM this is usually the same
as `patient.remote.model_name`.

### `patient.boilerplate_marker`

Line marker used by patient postprocessing to identify the boilerplate
conditions section heading.

### `patient.text_token_threshold`

Maximum token count used by local truncation before patient summarization.

## `embedding`

Configuration for summary embedding.

### `embedding.model_path`

Sentence-transformer model path passed to `SentenceTransformer(...)`.

### `embedding.device`

Device string passed to `SentenceTransformer(...)`.

### `embedding.prompt_file`

Prompt filename loaded from `matchminer_ai.prompts` and used as the embedding
query prompt.

### `embedding.max_seq_length`

Runtime truncation cutoff for embedding inputs. `SentenceTransformer`
uses this value during `encode()`, so inputs longer than this limit are
truncated before embedding generation. QC reports use the same value when
flagging summaries that exceed the embedding input limit.

## `match_quality`

Configuration for the match-quality checker model.

### `match_quality.model_name`

Text-classification model identifier used by the checker pipeline and model
metadata lookup.

### `match_quality.device`

Device passed to the checker pipeline.

### `match_quality.prompt_file`

Prompt template filename loaded from `matchminer_ai.prompts`.

### `match_quality.max_length`

Maximum token length passed to the text-classification checker pipeline.

### `match_quality.score_cutoff`

Minimum sigmoid-transformed checker score required for
`match_quality_pass == true`.

## `exclusion_criteria`

Configuration for the exclusion-criteria checker model.

### `exclusion_criteria.model_name`

Text-classification model identifier used by the checker pipeline and model
metadata lookup.

### `exclusion_criteria.device`

Device passed to the checker pipeline.

### `exclusion_criteria.prompt_file`

Prompt template filename loaded from `matchminer_ai.prompts`.

### `exclusion_criteria.max_length`

Maximum token length passed to the text-classification checker pipeline.

## `llm_match_quality`

Configuration for the LLM-based match-quality checker.

### `llm_match_quality.local`

Local in-process vLLM runtime settings. See `trial.local`.

### `llm_match_quality.prompt_file`

Prompt template filename loaded from `matchminer_ai.prompts`.

### `llm_match_quality.reasoning_parser`

vLLM reasoning parser name. The default `auto` resolves known model names,
including `google/gemma-4-31B-it` to `gemma4`. Non-vLLM remote endpoints may
return no separate reasoning field.

### `llm_match_quality.remote`

Task-specific remote chat completion request settings. See `trial.remote`.

## `llm_exclusion_criteria`

Configuration for the LLM-based exclusion-criteria checker.

### `llm_exclusion_criteria.local`

Local in-process vLLM runtime settings. See `trial.local`.

### `llm_exclusion_criteria.prompt_file`

Prompt template filename loaded from `matchminer_ai.prompts`.

### `llm_exclusion_criteria.reasoning_parser`

vLLM reasoning parser name. The default `auto` resolves known model names,
including `google/gemma-4-31B-it` to `gemma4`. Non-vLLM remote endpoints may
return no separate reasoning field.

### `llm_exclusion_criteria.remote`

Task-specific remote chat completion request settings. See `trial.remote`.

## `help_me_choose`

LLM task configuration for the optional matched-trial comparison. Its
`local` and `remote` blocks follow the same structure as `trial.local` and
`trial.remote`. Drug-information retrieval is intentionally separate from this
LLM block and never accepts patient text.

## `trial_space_contextualization`

Configuration for trial-only public-source retrieval and grounded synthesis.
Its `local` and `remote` blocks select the synthesis LLM. Additional fields
include:

- `sources`: default source adapter names (`nci_pdq`, `fda`, `civic`, and
  `pubmed`);
- `request_timeout`: public-source HTTP timeout in seconds;
- `max_concurrency`: maximum simultaneous source requests;
- `max_evidence_per_source`: per-space adapter result limit; and
- `pubmed_retmax`: retained for source-specific result tuning.

Optional source credentials and identification are read from environment
variables rather than configuration snapshots:

- `CIVIC_API_KEY`;
- `NCBI_EMAIL` and `NCBI_API_KEY`.

The NCBI API works without an API key at its lower public rate limit. Supplying
`NCBI_EMAIL` is recommended so requests identify the application operator.

## `patient_contextualization`

LLM task configuration for the separate per-patient, per-space review. This
stage does not call public-source adapters. Its `local` and `remote` blocks
follow the same structure as `trial.local` and `trial.remote`.
